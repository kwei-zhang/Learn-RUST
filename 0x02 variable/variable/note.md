# Variable

Rust by default will make the variable immutability, meaning you are not able to change the value of the variable after initialized
```
fn main() {
    let x = 5;
    println!("The value of x is: {x}");
    x = 6;
    println!("The value of x is: {x}");
}
```
The code above will give result of:
```
$ cargo run
   Compiling variables v0.1.0 (file:///projects/variables)
error[E0384]: cannot assign twice to immutable variable `x`

Although variables are immutable by default, you can make them mutable by adding `mut` in front of the variable name
```
fn main() {
    let mut x = 5;
    println!("The value of x is: {x}");
    x = 6;
    println!("The value of x is: {x}");
}
```
```

The value of x is: 6
```

## Contant
Like immutable variables, constants are values that are bound to a name and are not allowed to change, but there are a few differences between constants and variables.

- You are not allow to add mut to a constant to make it changeable
- Constants can be declared in any scope, including the global scope
- Constants may be set only to a constant expression, not the result of a value that could only be computed at runtime.

## Shadowing
You can declare a new variable with the same name as a previous variable. Rustaceans say that the first variable is shadowed by the second, which means that the second variable is what the compiler will see when you use the name of the variable.
```
fn main() {
    let x = 5;

    let x = x + 1;

    {
        let x = x * 2;
        println!("The value of x in the inner scope is: {x}");
    }

    println!("The value of x is: {x}");
}
```
```
$ cargo run
   Compiling variables v0.1.0 (file:///projects/variables)
    Finished `dev` profile [unoptimized + debuginfo] target(s) in 0.31s
     Running `target/debug/variables`
The value of x in the inner scope is: 12
The value of x is: 6
```
The other difference between mut and shadowing is that because weâ€™re effectively creating a new variable when we use the let keyword again, we can change the **type** of the value but reuse the same name.

# Data Type
Every value in Rust is of a certain data type, which tells Rust what kind of data is being specified so it knows how to work with that data. Weâ€™ll look at two data type subsets: scalar and compound.

## Scalar Types
A scalar type represents a single value. Rust has four primary scalar types: integers, floating-point numbers, Booleans, and characters. You may recognize these from other programming languages. Letâ€™s jump into how they work in Rust.

#### Integer
An integer is a number without a fractional component.
| Length   | Signed | Unsigned |
|----------|--------|----------|
| 8-bit    | i8     | u8       |
| 16-bit   | i16    | u16      |
| 32-bit   | i32    | u32      |
| 64-bit   | i64    | u64      |
| 128-bit  | i128   | u128     |
| arch     | isize  | usize    |

#### Floating-Point Types
Rust also has two primitive types for floating-point numbers, which are numbers with decimal points. Rustâ€™s floating-point types are `f32` and `f64`, which are 32 bits and 64 bits in size, respectively. The default type is `f64` because on modern CPUs, itâ€™s roughly the same speed as `f32` but is capable of more precision. All floating-point types are signed.
```
fn main() {
    let x = 2.0; // f64

    let y: f32 = 3.0; // f32
}
```

#### Numeric Operations
Rust supports the basic mathematical operations youâ€™d expect for all the number types: addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and remainder. Integer division truncates toward zero to the nearest integer.
```
fn main() {
    // addition
    let sum = 5 + 10;

    // subtraction
    let difference = 95.5 - 4.3;

    // multiplication
    let product = 4 * 30;

    // division
    let quotient = 56.7 / 32.2;
    let truncated = -5 / 3; // Results in -1

    // remainder
    let remainder = 43 % 5;
}
```

#### The Boolean Type
As in most other programming languages, a Boolean type in Rust has two possible values: true and false. Booleans are one byte in size. The Boolean type in Rust is specified using bool.
```
fn main() {
    let t = true;

    let f: bool = false; // with explicit type annotation
}
```

#### The Character Type
Rustâ€™s char type is the languageâ€™s most primitive alphabetic type.
```
fn main() {
    let c = 'z';
    let z: char = 'â„¤'; // with explicit type annotation
    let heart_eyed_cat = 'ðŸ˜»';
}
```

Note that we specify char literals with single quotes, as opposed to string literals, which use double quotes. Rustâ€™s char type is four bytes in size and represents a Unicode Scalar Value, which means it can represent a lot more than just ASCII. Accented letters; Chinese, Japanese, and Korean characters; emoji; and zero-width spaces are all valid char values in Rust.

## Compound Types
Compound types can group multiple values into one type. Rust has two primitive compound types: tuples and arrays.

#### The Tuple Type
A tuple is a general way of grouping together a number of values with a variety of types into one compound type. Tuples have a fixed length: once declared, they cannot grow or shrink in size.
```
fn main() {
    let tup: (i32, f64, u8) = (500, 6.4, 1);
}
```

#### The Array Type
Another way to have a collection of multiple values is with an array. Unlike a tuple, every element of an array must have the same type. Unlike arrays in some other languages, arrays in Rust have a fixed length.
```
fn main() {
    let a = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
    let b: [i32; 5] = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
    let c = [3; 5]; // let c = [3, 3, 3, 3, 3]

}
```
